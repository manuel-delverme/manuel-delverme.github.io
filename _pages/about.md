Hello world
This website is mainly as support of my research work, check the blog section for my articles on what was, and the projects tab for what will probably be!

My effort are divided in three categories:

Local, personal support
you can book me at https://calendly.com/manuel-delverme/15min to chat about research, life and general questions.

Giving back to the AI community
tools like [experiment_buddy] aim to make AI researcher's workflow as smooth as possible.

Globally, by working on important questions, such as, do we really need [silicon based] computation? can we build [interfaces adapting to the user] needs rather than the other way around? can we train  bigger neural networks in a [distributed fashion]?

I want to make sure that the world we are creating  is a good one, and we are not forgetting anybody behind.
