I track everything.

For over a decade, I've been logging my digital life: Spotify plays, GitHub commits, browser history, location data, messages, calendar events, finance transactions, health metrics. 26 data sources spanning 13+ years, all feeding into a personal database.

Why? Because I wanted to know what actually drives productivity. Not what books say. Not what productivity gurus claim. What the data shows.

## The Quantified Self

Most productivity advice is unfalsifiable. "Wake up early." "Meditate." "Exercise." These might work—but how would you know? Without data, you're running on vibes and confirmation bias.

I decided to measure instead of guess.

## What I've Found

Some findings confirm conventional wisdom:
- Momentum matters (yesterday's output predicts today's)
- Morning focus correlates with higher output

Some findings contradict it:
- More meetings correlate with *more* commits, not fewer
- Late nights correlate with peak productivity (when you're in flow)
- Sleep optimization is overrated for daily output (health is a constraint on T, not V(t))

Some findings surprised me:
- Spotify skip rate >20% predicts a 55% drop in next-day commits
- Hands-up/eurodance music correlates with 6+ commits/day
- Media volume, not timing, predicts next-day crashes

## The Framework

I think about life optimization as maximizing:

```
V_total = ∫₀ᵀ V(t) dt
```

Where:
- **V(t)** = daily value (flow, creation, connection, leverage)
- **T** = lifespan
- **V_total** = lifetime value

Health extends T. Everything else optimizes V(t). Most people confuse maintenance (T) with optimization (V(t)).

Here I share what the data says. No productivity theater. No unfalsifiable advice. Just patterns extracted from 13 years of personal tracking.
